### Awesome Sharing Economy

Here's a list of resources you can use to explore & contribute to the sharing economy. The sharing economy is a movement of people seeking to build new models of collaboration & governance which redistribute power to individuals & communities instead of corporations. 

> Help wanted: Please help contribute new resources! You can submit as aa github issue or pull request. Thank you!

This document includes:

- Important resources: Why should you care?
- Autonomous collectives 
- Co-living communities
- Other Cooperatives 
- Thought-leaders
- Literature  
- Magazines & Newsletters

It's my belief that our environments & communities will continue to be destroyed by those with concentrated power until we learn to take that power into our own hands and wield it. We have to work together take responsibility for our own lives, our we'll continue to be abused. 

Good luck!
